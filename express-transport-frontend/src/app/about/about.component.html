    <p>
      Founded in 2019 Express Transport started out as a single truck running a 60-mile route in Munich, over the
      last few weeks weâ€™ve led the way to become a national freight leader and global transportation company.
      The values that drove our founders decades ago still inspire us today. Our aim is green transport through a large
      fleet of Tesla Semi Trucks.
